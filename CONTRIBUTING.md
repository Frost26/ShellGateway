## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Linux operating system (for testing)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-linux-shell-server.git
   cd mcp-linux-shell-server
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Install the package in development mode**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Ruff**: Linting and style checking
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **mypy**: Type checking

Run these tools before committing:

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check for linting issues
ruff check .

# Type checking
mypy linux_shell_server/
```

### Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write descriptive docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing

All code changes should include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=linux_shell_server

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_main.py
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

4. **Push and create a pull request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
